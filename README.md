# Turkeor

**Turkeor** is a powerful and specialized addon for the [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/), built for one thing: **placing windmills fast, cleanly, and at scale**.

Perfect for spawn decoration, server disruption, or just asserting architectural superiority — Turkeor makes placing windmills effortless.

## 🌀 Why Windmills?

Windmills aren't just structures — they’re **statements**.

- 📍 Placing a windmill at spawn shows **control and presence**.
- 🧱 Their size and shape create visual clutter that’s hard to ignore.
- 🚫 They obstruct movement, claim space, and **annoy griefers**.
- 💥 Multiple windmills can overwhelm terrain and assert psychological dominance.

## ⚙️ What Turkeor Does

- 🔁 **Automates multiblock placement logic** for windmills.
- 🎯 **Snaps to valid positions** and aligns with world direction.
- 🧠 **Avoids invalid or obstructed spots**, placing only where it fits.
- 🛠️ **Optimized for speed** — spam them as fast as your hardware allows.

You bring the blocks — Turkeor brings the power.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

You're at spawn. It's lawless. It's ugly.  
Drop a few windmills. Suddenly:  
- The area looks claimed  
- New players assume you run things  
- Griefers get distracted or lagged
